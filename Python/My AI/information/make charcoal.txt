Charcoal is a lightweight black carbon residue produced by strongly 
heating wood (or other animal and plant materials) in minimal oxygen 
to remove all water and volatile constituents.

Common charcoal is made from peat, coal, wood, coconut shell, or petroleum.

To make lump charcoal, fill a metal container (one with a high melting point) with
any hardwoods: alder, balsa, beech, hickory, mahogany, maple, oak, teak, and walnut.
Sticks, logs, planks, and sawdust can be used.

Place lid on the container and seal tight. Make one or more small holes in the top of the lid
to allow wood gases to escape. 

Start fire and place container in the middle of it. As the gasses escape they will ignite 
and a small flame will appear from the opening of the lid.

Once the flames have dissipaited cover the holes in the lid or flip over container if possible.
Wait for the container to cool down and pry lid off. If successful charcoal will have formed.

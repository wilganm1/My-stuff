Dynamite, a high explosive combining nitroglycerin with an absorbent medium such as wood 
pulp, cellulose, saw dust or diatomaceous earth, revolutionized construction and mining. Dynamite is one 
example of a chemical explosive, or anything that, once ignited, burns extremely 
rapidly and produces a large amount of hot gas in the process. The hot gas expands 
very rapidly and applies pressure. This pressure creates a shockwave.

Other explosives that you commonly hear about are nitroglycerin and TNT, but anything 
from gasoline to ammonium nitrate mixed with other substances to special plastic 
explosives are in the same class.

Most true explosives contain the oxygen they need for burning in the chemical. 
This allows burning to occur much more quickly. Nitroglycerin, for example, has 
the chemical formula C3H5(ONO2)3. The carbon and hydrogen combine with oxygen, 
and the nitrogen is liberated.

Dynamite is usually sold in the form of cardboard cylinders about 200 mm (8 in) 
long and about 32 mm (1+1‚ÅÑ4 in) in diameter, with a mass of about 190 grams (.41 pound).
A stick of dynamite thus produced contains roughly 1 MJ (megajoule) of energy.
Other sizes also exist, rated by either portion (Quarter-Stick or Half-Stick) or by weight.

Dynamite is usually rated by "weight strength" (the amount of nitroglycerin it contains), 
usually from 20% to 60%. For example, 40% dynamite is composed of 40% nitroglycerin 
and 60% "dope" (the absorbent storage medium mixed with the stabilizer and any additives).

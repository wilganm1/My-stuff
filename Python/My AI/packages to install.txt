GIS libraries

folium - interactive map with markers pop-ups chorolpleths (color maps based on data),
ipyleaflet - interactive maps, JavaScript dependency
geoplot - quick and easy visualization, not interactive
pyproj - project and transform coordinates with a range of geographic reference systems. PyProj can also perform geodetic calculations and distances for any given datum.,
rsgislib - sensing tools for raster processing and analysis. Classifies, filters, and performs statistics on imagery.,
gdal/ogr - translating between GIS formats and extensions,
geopandas - vector geospatial data. Requires Shapely for geometric operations, Fiona to access files, matplotlib for plotting.
  Fiona - ,
  Shapely - ,
ReportLab - creating reports,
arcpy, 
rasterio - raster data. read & write satellite imagery, perform terrain analysis
LiDAR - process lidar data, tools to smooth, filter, and extract topological properties from digital elevation models (DEMs)

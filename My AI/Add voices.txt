I want to add new voices.

Click start button on Windows. Type or click "Run". 

Type in 'regedit' into the bar. Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/MICROSOFT/SPEECH/VOICES/TOKENS

Look at where the voices are located.

Make a new key, which is a folder, and just copy all the features of the other voices. All the files you need should be in the folder LangDataPath and VoicePath keys. The files should be:
    M10333{name of voice}.APM
    M10333{name of voice}.DEP
    M10333{name of voice}.INI

Python 3.8, Windows 10, Pyttsx3 version = 2.7

1. Download voices from the Narrator settings. Find Narrator in settings and click Add Voices. Click the languages and regions you want.

2. Click start button on Windows. Type or click "Run".

3. Type in 'regedit' into the bar, hit enter, then click yes. This is the Microsoft registry editor. Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/MICROSOFT/SPEECH/VOICES/TOKENS
This will have 2 folders, one for each default voice. They should be David and Zira. They should be named -TTS_MS_EN-US_{name}_11.0 or something like that.

4) Click on '  -TTS_MS_EN-US_{name}_11.0  ' and look at LangDataPath. Go to that folder and check if your downloaded voice are there too. Make sure you're looking in the correct language folder. You could have en-US, en-GB, en-CA, etc.

5) Now create a new folder within Tokens. Right-click on Tokens folder and add a new key, which creates a new folder, and just copy all the features of the other voices, except for the new voice/language. Give the folder the same exact label (case-sensitive) as the default ones except swap out the name for the new voice. Then make a sub folder called Attributes. Once that's done, just copy the same exact format as the Attributes folder for the pre-installed pyttsx3 voices, with Age = Adult for all, gender = gender based on name, and language based on their language. 409 for US, and 809 for UK/GB, etc.

For example, here's the pre-installed voice for David - English (US)
-TTS_MS_EN-US_DAVID_11.0

|             ******* If the voice is British, EN-GB, change 409 to 809*******
-Attributes
    Name                 Type         Data
    -(Default)          REG_SZ     (value not set)
    -Age                REG_SZ     Adult
    -Gender             REG_SZ     Male
    -Language           REG_SZ     409
    -Name               REG_SZ     Microsoft David Desktop

    -SpLexicon          REG_SZ     {0655E396-25D0-11D3-9C26-00C04F8EF87C}
    -Vendor             REG_SZ     Microsoft
    -Version            REG_SZ     11.0


These are the files you need for VoicePath. David and Zira had these 3.
M10333{name of voice}.APM
M10333{name of voice}.DEP
M10333{name of voice}.INI

All rights of the voices used go to their respective voice actor/actress & any & all parties legally contracted with them.

These are people/characters from video games & anime that I would like to turn into synthsized voices. The problem is that this most definitley probably illegal. 
And on top of that no service with this software will turn any of these characters' voices into a robot voice without authentication. Microsoft Azure needs verification from an actual business, and Descript needs you to read a sentence to verify that the voice is yours. 

But I could maybe cheat the system with Descript. I found on video on YouTube that shows you how to make a custom siri voice:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSSsVhoR7FQ. This works by taking about utterances of every single sound in the English language, and writing words with it. I could possibly make an voice of whoever I want, and will just have to copy the text that the Descript gives me. It will be a rough reading, but it might work. This will take some time, but if it does work I can get my own custom AI voice of a character I want. Having Pain or Itachi from Naruto as a synthesized voice for my AI assistant 
would be awesome.

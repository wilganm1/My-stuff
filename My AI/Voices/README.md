All rights to the voices used go to their respective voice actor/actress & any & all parties legally contracted with them.

There are people/characters from video games & anime that I would like to turn into synthsized voices. The problem is that this is probably most definitley illegal. 
And on top of that no service with this software will turn any of these characters' voices into a robot voice without authentication. Microsoft Azure needs verification from an actual business, and Descript needs you to read a sentence to verify that the voice is yours. 

But I could maybe cheat the system with Descript. I found a video on YouTube that shows you how to make a custom siri voice:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSSsVhoR7FQ. This works by taking utterances of every single sound in the English language, and writing words with it. I could possibly make a voice of whoever I want, and will just have to copy the text that the Descript gives me. It will be a rough reading, but it might work. This will take some time, but if it does work I can get my own custom AI voice of a character I want. Having Pain or Itachi from Naruto or Zamasu from Dragon Ball Super as a synthesized voice for my AI assistant 
would be awesome.

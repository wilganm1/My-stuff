:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::BASICS::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
To affect all of the page, use body{} in css, UNLESS there is a more specific place. #IDs > .classes > <tags>.
  
Use !important to ensure a style is absolute and set.

*****Set width of page div to 100%

	viewport is the viewable area on a device. 10vw means 10% of the 
			viewable width on a device.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::IMAGES:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

 -Height and width of an <img> in a div must go within the html file itself, NOT the css file.
 	-<img src="(IMAGE)" width="x" height="y">

 background image goes in the body{} of a CSS file.

body { background-image: url("");
	  background-size: cover;} 	  -Auto fits image perfectly

-Load from a folder: url('.../folder1/folder/image.jpg')

-background-image:
height:				 -height of box: px, em, % SET TO AUTO
width: 			     -width of box. px, em, % PUT IN BODY
border-radius: px    -Changes corners of border into 
		50%					-makes a circle.
padding: xpx ypx     -clears area inside border, around content.
min-width:           -sets smallest possible width.
max-width:           -sets largest possible width.
background-repeat	 -whether the image repeats. -x or -y
	-no-repeat:			-Only one single image
background-size:	 -How big the image is.
	-cover:				-perfectly scales the image to it's div

:::::::::::::::::::::::::FLOW OF HTML:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
 **How HTML reads input. Left-to-right, then top-down.**
       Mostly used within divs
 -static: 			-default
 -relative:			-changes relative to it's normal position on page.
 	-top:				-moves the object DOWN. AWAY from top
 	-bottom:			-moves it UP. AWAY from bottom
 	-left:				-moves it RIGHT. AWAY from left
 	-right:				-moves it LEFT. AWAY from right
 -absolute: 		-does not change position

 -line-height:		-the vertical spacing between text lines.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::COLOR:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
-Color:                     -Color of text
-Background-color:     	    -color of the background
 -rgb(x, y, z)             -specified color information
 -hsla(120, 60%, 70%, 0.5) -hsl(0-360 hue, saturation, lightness, opacity)
 -linear-gradient(xdeg, y, z..n) -y & z are colors of gradient
 

    ------------------------GRADIENTS------------------------------
Gradients are when two colors fade into each other or to transparency.
	***Must use {background-image} in css for it to work
-background-image:
  -linear-gradient(x,y,z)   -transition of colors. x=direction, 
								y&z=colors.
  -repeating-linear-gradient(deg, y, z, n) -gradient that repeats
 		blue: 0px
 		blue: 40px		 -How gradient works. Can set where they start & end
 		red: 40px		 	-Doing it like this makes solid bars
 		red: 80px

  -radial-gradient		   -transition of colors in circular patter.
	 Weird to explain. Example: (red 29%, yellow 32%, green 70%)
	   -Think of it this way, the latter percentages are how big the radius before them is. Changing the former changes its transparency gradient
	  Green determines how big yellow's radius is. However, changing yellow's % will change it's transparency gradient, and red's radius. Chaning red's % will only change it's transparnecy gradient.

	 Changing green only changes yellow's radius, chaning yellow changes it's transparency & red's radius, and changing red only changes it's transparency.

	 Example: If you make green 60%, the yellow circle will get smaller. If you make the yellow 28%, yellow will become more transparent and the red cirlce will get smaller. If red beomes 28%, it will become opaque, and overtake yellow completely. And the reverse is true

  - repeating-radial-gradient(color1 %, color2%)
  		-continuous repeating of colors in circle. like a pond ripple
  		The closer color1's % is to color2's %, the more ripples.

  	******Inner number expands ripples outward, outer number pulls ripples inward******
  			-Decreasing latter % shrinks it's radius and brings in the former color. 
  			-Increasing former causes inner circle to get bigger. **When the former color is > 1/2 of outer color, a new ripple starts**
  		Example: magenta 1%, black 100% -Black fills up corners of div
  			-decreasing black shrinks black's radius and magenta comes in
  				-The smaller black is, the more ripples. 
  				-Black is between space between magenta circle.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::PSEUDO-CLASSES:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Pseudo-classes are "classes" that allow changes. They work when
something on the webpage happens, like when a box is hovered or a link
is clicked on. This is when these psuedo-classes activate.

  selector:psuedo-class{property: value}

-Structural
:first-child			-matches specified element that is first child of 
						 another element.
:last-child				-last child of a parent element
:nth-child				-nth number child of a parent element
-Link
 :link
 :visited				-when a link is visited
-User Action
 :hover 				-when mouse hovers over an element
 :active 				-when mouse is held down over element
 :focus 			    -focused on when tab button used
-Forms
 :enabled 			    -
 :checked 				-if checkbox is clicked
 :disabled
-Textual
 :first-letter			-changes first letter of an element
 :first-line 			-changes first line of an element
-Positonal

-grid-column-gap: 		-gap between each grid column box
-grid-row-start:        -Dictate how many rows a grid item is.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::CREATE A TABLE:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Creates a table with as many rows as you want.

*******To inpute data into table you need <td> tag.********
		*****Column borders are done in <th> tag*****
			**Add lines using:
		table, th, td{border: 1px solid #888;
				margin-top: 0.3rem;
    			padding-left: 0.3rem;
    			padding-right: 0.3rem;}
    separae into boxes using border-collapse: collapse;


<caption>						  -adds a top caption above head
<table>							  -the table input
	<tbody>						  -creates body outline
		<tr>					  -Creates a new row
			<th>1st column</th>   -HEADINGS of columns
			<th>2nd column</th>
			<th>nth column</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>1st column</td>   -Adds data value to table box 
			<td>2nd column</td> 
			.................
	</tbody>
</table>

-<td rowspan="n">				-Spanning multiple rows. n rows
-<td colspan="n">				-Spanning multiple columns. n columns

You can style even and odd rows differently by using pseudo-classes instead
of manually typing class="odd_row" / class="even_row" using nth-child

tr:nth-child(odd){background-color: ~~~}
tr:nth-child(even){background-color: ~~~}

   You can use > to lead from one psuedo-class to another

 tr:nth-child(odd)>td:last-child {border-radius: 0 0 25px 0}
 -this says the last data point in the last row has a border radius
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::FORMS:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

 ****Must have @keyframes NAME OF ANIMATION {} to execute the animation****

 	@keyframes animation-name:

**You can change what happens at different times of the animation cycle using percentages (%). This happens

 #anim{ animation-name: colorful;
 animation-duration:3s}

@keyframes colorful { 0%
 	{background-color: blue;
} 100%

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::RESPONSIVE DESIGN:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Responsive design is changing the layout of your site when on screens of 
different sizes, such as an iphone vs a computer.

Use the @media followed by the screen size in pixels, then normal code

 @media (200px) {			-Changes when screen is at most 200 px
 background-color: red 		-the change that happens to whatever
}

 @media screen and (min-width: )

# Fret finder, a desktop app for guitar.

Fret finder, a desktop exe file that will display all the frets for any scale in any tuning. You select the tuning you use, the root note for the scale you want, and the type of scale you want, hit the button that says "Get" and it will automatically display all the frets for the scale. On top of that, a diagram of the guitar neck will be displayed for a visual tool. Now you can easily write tabs/songs to your heart's content with this. Have fun.

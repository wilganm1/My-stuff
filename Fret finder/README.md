# Fret finder, a desktop app for guitar.

Have you ever wanted to write a song with a certain scale, but for the tuning you're on you don't know which frets have notes that are in that scale? Well Fret finder
does all that for you. You select the tuning you use, the root note for the scale you want, and the type of scale you want, hit the button that says "Get" and it will
automatically display all the frets for the scale. On top of that, a diagram of the guitar neck will be displayed for a visual tool. Now you can easily write tabs/songs to your heart's content with this. Have fun.

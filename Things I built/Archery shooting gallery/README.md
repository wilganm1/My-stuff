I've been getting into archery and I wanted a place to shoot in my backyard. I bought some hay bales with targets put on them to shoot at, which cost ~ $65. I did buy one Swatlo 20" diameter straw target on Amazon for $50 to hang up too. Buying hay bales is cheaper since you get more targets for less. The paper targets put on the hay were from Morrell that I bought at a Bass Pro Shop for $1 each.

## Finished design

### Building it
I had old wooden posts around my house used to make a garden but were no longer needed. I used 7 in total. All the string was cut off beforehand.

The first two posts were uncut and meant to hold the hay bales and are standing straight up with their ends cut at an angle to dig into the soil better. I used a sledgehammer to hit them in until they were somewhat stable.
All the wood was cut with a miter saw in my garage.

I had the vertical posts just on the outside of the hay bales. I did this to minimze the chances of an arrow hitting the wood. I then connected the two vertical posts with 3 horizontal supports for more stability and so the hay bales could fall backwards slightly towards the middle, making them more stable.

To increase stability I cut two pieces at an angle to stop the vertical wood from moving backwards due to the weight of the hay.

I then pounded two end pieces of cut wood into the ground with the sledgehammer. My original idea was to screw/glue the supports to these stoppers, but instead I just put the supports against them. I could always change my mind in the future.

And that was it. Now I have targets to shoot at and it's all fixed to the ground. I just used a saw, a drill, and some screws.

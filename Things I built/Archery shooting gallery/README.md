I've been getting into archery and I wanted a place to shoot in my backyard. I bought some hay bales with targets put on them to shoot at, which cost ~ $65. I did buy one straw target Swatlo 20" diameter straw target on Amazon ($50) but buying the hay was cheaper for more targets. The paper targets put on the hay were from Morrell that I bought at a Bass Pro Shop for $1 each.

### Building it
I had old wooden posts around my house used to make a garden but were no longer needed. I used 7 in total. All the string was cut off before they were cut The first two were uncut and meant to hold the hay bales and are standing straight up with their ends cut at an angle to dig into the soil better. I used a sledgehammer to hit them in so they were somewhat stable.

I first cut the string off with a box cutter and cut with the miter saw for the correct angles I needed

I had the vertical posts just on the outside of the hay bales. I did this to minimze the chances of an arrow hitting the wood. I then connected the two vertical posts with 3 other posts for more stability and so the hay bales could fall backwards toward the middle, making them more stable.

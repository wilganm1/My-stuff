"""  Idea to combine computer programming and biology, mainly gene therapy & CRISPR technology.

    Build software in C++/Java or Python that will basically display how certain genes build the body of organisms.
    
    I got the idea from a black & white cat I saw on a YouTube thumbnail. It was all black on most of its body but the feet and legs are white, along with
    certain part of it's face. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w4roG3Gjro
    I saw it and thought to myself, wow that is a really interesting pattern, I wonder what genes the cat has to get that patter.
    Just like how a tiger's stripes follow a pattern of genes. 
    
    So my idea is to make a software where an organism (like a cat) is displayed and you are able to alter the cat's body and the genes that would cause 
    that to happen would be effected. Or you can remove certain genes or add them to get potential effect.
    
    The first thing to try is cosmetics and bone length. If this can work it will be able to how changing genes affects the body.

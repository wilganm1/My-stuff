This is my custom made rock paper scissors game I wrote in Python. 
You are able to choose what the score limit is and you can restart the entire game when that limit has been reached.
You first enter the score limit you want, then you choose either "rock", "paper", or "scissors".
The computer randomly chooses any of those options, and the code runs with the game's rules.
You keep going until either you or the computer hits the limit, then you can choose to replay it or quit with "y" or "n"

Feel free to copy this.
